To verify the localization of endogenous GNE observed by
immunofluorescence, we analyzed the distribution of a
recombinantly expressed N-terminally (FLAG) 3 -tagged version of
GNE. 

-- Localization of GNE (endogenous) was done via analysis of
distribution of recombinant N-terminally FLAG 3 tagged version of
GNE. 

At about 50% confluency, HeLa cells were transfected with an
amphotropic retrovirus containing GNE cDNA (coding exons
2\u201312) under the control of a CMV promoter. 

-- GNE cDNA /w CMV promoter into HeLa cells.

The cells were stained simultaneously with an anti-FLAG antibody
and the GNE antibody. 

-- Stained with anti-FLAG antibody and GNE antibody.

Confocal laser scan- ning microscopy revealed colocalization in
the Golgi and the nucleus (Fig. 5).

-- Colocalization in Golgi and nucleus.

Additionally, (FLAG) 3 -tagged GNE translation products were
visualized in several small clusters in the cytoplasm. 

-- FLAG 3 tagged GNE seen in several small clusters in cytoplasm
[should I worry about this in my research?]

Unlike endogenous GNE, the FLAG-tagged construct marks the Golgi
complex more strongly than the nucleus.

-- FLAG tagged marks golgi stronger than endogenous GNE. [Could
be since FLAG tag associates better than GNE antiserum].

Unexpectedly, a large fraction of GNE is targeted to the
nucleoplasm and a few intensely stained subnuclear domains of
HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy (Figs. 3A, E, H,
K). 

-- Large fraction of GNE is targeted to the nucleoplasm and a few
intensely stained subnuclear domains of HeLa cells.

Upon BFA treatment disrupting the Golgi complex, the nuclear
distribution of GNE remains largely unchanged for 1 h (Fig. 4A),
when compared to untreated HeLa cells (Fig. 3). 

-- BFA Golgi disruption does not affect nuclear distribution.

During recovery from BFA, intensely staining nuclear domains
become prominent after 2 h (Figs. 4D, G).  

-- BFA recovery leads to intensifying nuclear staining.

Upon nocodazole treatment and recovery, the nuclear GNE signal is
heterogenous in the cell population.  Nuclear GNE is nearly
missing or weaker in about half of the cells and more prominent
in the other half lacking any larger nuclear clusters (Figs. 4J,
M).  

-- Nocadazole disruption and recovery leaves GNE nuclear signal
heterogenous, while nuclear GNE is nearly missing or weaker in
about half of the cells and more prominent in the other half
lacking any larger nuclear clusters. [What?]

In general, the GNE-related nuclear staining pattern in HeLa
cells was variable (Figs. 3A, E, H, K) and changed rapidly upon
recovery from BFA treatment and during exposure to nocodazole
(Figs. 4D, G, J, M). 

-- Generaly, GNE-related nuclear staining pattern in HeLa varies
and change rapidly upon recovery from BFA and nocodazole
exposure.

These findings prompted us to analyze HeLa cells in culture over
time. 


Cells were seeded at low density and maintained for 6 days with
one medium exchange on day 4. 


For confocal microscopy analysis, the cells were labeled for GNE
and golgin-97. 

The nuclear GNE distribution changes over time including
increased cluster formation and a decrease in diffuse
nucleoplasmic staining until day 4. 

-- Nuclear GNE distribution changes over time include increased
cluster formation, decrease in dffuse nucleoplasmic staining
until day 4.

The day following medium exchange (day 5), GNE appears diffusely
throughout the nucleo- plasm concentrating in numerous smaller
granules. 

-- After medium exchange, GNE diffuse throughout the nucleoplasm
concentrating in smaller granules.

On day 6, GNE seems again redistributed into 1\u20133 large,
intensely labeled nuclear domains (data not shown).  

-- Day 6, GNE redistribute into 1-3 large intensely laveled
nuclear domains.

The relative nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GNE was determined
by cell fractionation of HeLa cells 1 and 2 days after seeding. 

Purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by
Western Blot analysis and subsequent immunodetection of golgin-97
as cytoplasmic marker and C responsive element-binding protein
(CBP) as nuclear marker protein (data not shown). 

Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were normalized for total
protein and separated on a Western blot followed by
immunodetection with the GNE antibody (Fig. 1D). 


Densitometry analysis of the specific immunoblot signals reveals
nuclear versus cytoplasmic GNE ratios ranging from 1:1.7 on day 1
and 1:2.3 on day 2.

-- nuclear to cytoplasmic GNE ratios from 1:1.7 & 1:2.3.

To investigate the subcellular targeting of GNE in cells of
myogenic origin, TE671 cells, a rhabdomyosarcoma line and fetal
human myoblasts (FHM) were double labeled for GNE and a Golgi
marker and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Figs.
6A\u2013F). 

-- GNE & golgi markers

Colocalization occurs in an intensely stained juxtanuclear
compartment typical of the Golgi complex. 

-- juxtanuclear staining - typical to golgi. 

Moreover, most of the nuclei are labeled by the anti-GNE antibody
(Figs.  6A, D) and display a similar staining pattern like HeLa
cells.

-- Similar staining pattern like HeLa


After maturation of FHM into differentiated, multinuclear
myotubes, the Golgi appa- ratus appears as a vesicular
juxtanuclear structure (Figs. 


6G\u2013 I) that is less compact when compared to myoblasts
(Figs.  6D\u2013F). GNE is also present in a widespread nuclear
staining pattern in most of the myotubes (Figs. 6G, I).  

-- GNE presnet in widespread nuclear staining pattern in most
myotubes. [mature FHM]
