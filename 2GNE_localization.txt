Unexpectedly, a large fraction of GNE is targeted to the
nucleoplasm and a few intensely stained subnuclear domains of
HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy (Figs. 3A, E, H,
K). 

Upon BFA treatment disrupting the Golgi complex, the nuclear
distribution of GNE remains largely unchanged for 1 h (Fig. 4A),
when compared to untreated HeLa cells (Fig. 3). 

During recovery from BFA, intensely staining nuclear domains
become prominent after 2 h (Figs. 4D, G).  

Upon nocodazole treatment and recovery, the nuclear GNE signal is
heterogenous in the cell population.  Nuclear GNE is nearly
missing or weaker in about half of the cells and more prominent
in the other half lacking any larger nuclear clusters (Figs. 4J,
M).  

In general, the GNE-related nuclear staining pattern in HeLa
cells was variable (Figs. 3A, E, H, K) and changed rapidly upon
recovery from BFA treatment and during exposure to nocodazole
(Figs. 4D, G, J, M). 

These findings prompted us to analyze HeLa cells in culture over
time. 

Cells were seeded at low density and maintained for 6 days with
one medium exchange on day 4. 

For confocal microscopy analysis, the cells were labeled for GNE
and golgin-97. 

The nuclear GNE distribution changes over time including
increased cluster formation and a decrease in diffuse
nucleoplasmic staining until day 4. 

The day following medium exchange (day 5), GNE appears diffusely
throughout the nucleo- plasm concentrating in numerous smaller
granules. 

On day 6, GNE seems again redistributed into 1\u20133 large,
intensely labeled nuclear domains (data not shown).  

The relative nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GNE was determined
by cell fractionation of HeLa cells 1 and 2 days after seeding. 

Purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by
Western Blot analysis and subsequent immunodetection of golgin-97
as cytoplasmic marker and C responsive element-binding protein
(CBP) as nuclear marker protein (data not shown). 

Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were normalized for total
protein and separated on a Western blot followed by
immunodetection with the GNE antibody (Fig. 1D). 

Densitometry analysis of the specific immunoblot signals reveals
nuclear versus cytoplasmic GNE ratios ranging from 1:1.7 on day 1
and 1:2.3 on day 2.
