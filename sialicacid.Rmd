**Sialic Acid**
What are Sialic acids?
Sialic acids are a derivative of neuraminic acid,
an acidic sugar with a nine carbon backbone. 
The most common member of this group is N-acetylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Ac or NANA).

Where are they located?
Sialic acids are located on the distal side of glycan chains
in many vertebrate cell surface glycoconjugates
Kraus2005 ref 1 - Rens-Domiano 1991

What are sialic acids for?
Regulation of glycoprotein stability
Kraus2005 ref 1 - Rens-Domiano 1991
, cruicial in controlling cellular 
interactions, including cell adhesion,

Experiments using inactivation of sialic acid biosynthesis by gene targeting
causes early embryonic lethality in mice.
Kraus2005 ref 13.

N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is the most abundant naturally occuring sialic
acid and.
Kraus2005
It serves as a precursor substrate for the entire class of compounds.
Kraus2005

In mamals, biosynthesis of sialic acid results in Neu5Ac and its activated form
CMP-Neu5Ac is given by five consecutive enzymatic steps.
Kraus2005 ref 14 - for review see this ref.
Key enzyme of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway is the
bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-ace-
tylmannosamine kinase (GNE).

GNE catalyzes the two initial steps of sialic acid biosynthesis.
Kraus2005 ref 15.

In continuum to above, And so GNE determine the extent of cell
surface sialylation in hooman cells.
Kraus2005 ref 16
The final step in sialic acid biosynthesis is the activation of
Neu5Ac to the sugar neclotide CMP-Neu5Ac and is catalyzed by
CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, therby providing the substrate for
Golgi-resistant sialyltransferases.
