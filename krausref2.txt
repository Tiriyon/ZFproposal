           Vestweber, Dietmar, and James E. Blanks. Mechanisms That Regulate the Function of the Selectins and Their
           Ligands. Physiol. Rev. 79: 181–213, 1999.—Selectins are a family of three cell adhesion molecules (L-, E-, and P-
           selectin) specialized in capturing leukocytes from the bloodstream to the blood vessel wall. This initial cell contact
           is followed by the selectin-mediated rolling of leukocytes on the endothelial cell surface. This represents the first step
           in a cascade of molecular interactions that lead to leukocyte extravasation, enabling the processes of lymphocyte
           recirculation and leukocyte migration into inflamed tissue. The central importance of the selectins in these processes
           has been well documented in vivo by the use of adhesion-blocking antibodies as well as by studies on selectin
           gene-deficient mice. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression and function(s) of
           the selectins and their ligands. Cell-surface expression of the selectins is regulated by a variety of different mecha-
           nisms. The selectins bind to carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. Glycoproteins
           are the most likely candidates for physiologically relevant ligands. Only a few glycoproteins are appropriately
           glycosylated to allow strong binding to the selectins. Recently, more knowledge about the structure and the regulated
           expression of some of the carbohydrates on these ligands necessary for selectin binding has been accumulated.
           For at least one of these ligands, the physiological function is now well established. A novel and exciting aspect
           is the signaling function of the selectins and their ligands. Especially in the last two years, convincing data have
           been published supporting the idea that selectins and glycoprotein ligands of the selectins participate in the
           activation of leukocyte integrins.

      FIG. 1. Entry of leukocytes into tissue is controlled by a cascade of multiple molecular interactions. Initial tethering
of leukocytes to the endothelial cell surface is mediated by selectins. This enables leukocytes to roll along the blood
vessel wall and to sense activating factors such as chemokines that are deposited on the endothelial cell surface. This
leads to activation of leukocyte integrins that bind to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and mediate firm
adhesion, a prerequisite for directed migration of leukocytes on the endothelial cell surface. An increasing number of
recent reports suggest that in addition to chemokines, selectins are also directly involved in integrin activation.
