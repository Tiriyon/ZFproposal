## Methods

What do I do with my research? Essentially, I inject GFP or mCh
frankenbody probe as mRNA to zebrafish 1-cell stage. Alongside
that I inject recombinant GNE mRNA with HA Tag at the N-terminal
of the protein. After which I want to examine the injected larvae
with confocal microscopy.

Before I achieve that, I need to clone human GNE and design a
recombinant GNE. I need to examine the following parameters:

- HA tag position
- HA tag repeats
- HA tag conformation

Before that I need to enable IV for my FB

After that I need to examine FB & DNM plasmid microinjection.

And FB & DNM mRNA microinjection.

Which FB is better for visualization.
