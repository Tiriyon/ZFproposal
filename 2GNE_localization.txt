Abstract

    The bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is essential for early embryonic
development and catalyzes the rate limiting step in sialic acid biosynthesis. Although epimerase and kinase activities have been attributed to
GNE, little is known about the regulation, differential expression, and subcellular localization of GNE in vivo. Mutations in GNE cause a rare
inherited muscle disorder in humans called hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). However, the role of GNE in HIBM pathogenesis
has not been defined yet. Here, we show that the GNE protein is expressed in various mammalian cells and tissues with highest levels found
in cancer cells and liver. In human skeletal muscle, GNE protein is developmentally regulated: high levels are found in immature myoblasts
but low levels in mature skeletal muscle. The GNE protein colocalizes with resident proteins of the Golgi compartment in a variety of human
cells including muscle. Drug-induced disruption of the Golgi and subsequent recovery reveals co-distribution of GNE along with Golgi-
targeted proteins. This subcellular localization of GNE is in good agreement with its established role as the key enzyme of sialic acid
biosynthesis, since the sialylation of glycoconjugates takes place in the Golgi complex. Surprisingly, GNE is also detected in the nucleus.
Upon nocodazole treatment, GNE redistributes to the cytoplasm suggesting that GNE may act as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. A
regulatory role for GNE shifting between the nuclear and the Golgi compartment is proposed. Further insight into GNE regulation may
promote the understanding of HIBM pathogenesis.

Introduction

**Sialic Acid**
What are Sialic acids?
Sialic acids are a derivative of neuraminic acid,
an acidic sugar with a nine carbon backbone. 
The most common member of this group is N-acetylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Ac or NANA).

Where are they located?
Sialic acids are located on the distal side of glycan chains
in many vertebrate cell surface glycoconjugates

What are sialic acids for?
Regulation of glycoprotein stability, cruicial in controlling cellular 
interactions, including cell adhesion, modulation of surgace recognition
determinants, and B-cell signaling.

Sialic acids are located on the distal side of glycan chains               
in many vertebrate cell surface glycoconjugates and play                      
important roles in regulating glycoprotein stability [1]. 
They are crucial in controlling cellular interactions, including cell
adhesion [2], modulation of surface recognition determi-
nants [3,4], and B-cell signaling [5]. In addition, sialic acids
have been implicated in pathogenic processes such as
inflammation [6,7], adhesion of viruses or bacteria to tar-      
get cells [8–10], tumorigenesis, and metastasis [11,12].

Fig. 4. GNE association with the Golgi compartment is disturbed by brefeldin A (BFA) and Nocodazole. HeLa cells were treated with BFA (1 Ag/ml) for 1 h
(A–I). Co-immunostaining of GNE (red, Texas Red, A) and golgin-97 (green, FITC, B) followed by confocal microscopy reveals complete disruption of the
Golgi apparatus. The superimposition of red and green images shows some BFA-induced redistribution of GNE together with Golgi-associated proteins near
the nuclear envelope (yellow, C). In addition, the GNE antibody displays a widespread staining of the nucleus (A and C). The cells depicted in panels D–I were
allowed to recover after BFA treatment for the times indicated. One hour following removal of BFA, golgin-97 reclusters in more compact vesicles (E). GNE
partially localizes to these vesicles (D) as illustrated by the overlay in yellow (F). Two hours after removal of BFA, the Golgi-apparatus is recovered as
monitored by golgin-97 (H). GNE only partially colocalizes with Golgi-specific markers in the overlay (I). A major fraction of GNE is found in the nucleus.
Redistribution of GNE to nuclear clusters becomes more prominent 2 h after BFA treatment (compare D and G). Effect of nocodazole on the localization of
GNE in HeLa cells (J–O). Double immunolabeling of GNE (J) and golgin-97 (K) after nocodazole treatment (30 AM) for 1.5 h shows the formation of golgin-
97-positive cytoplasmic vesicles most of them colocalizing with GNE (L). Additionally, GNE appears prominent in the nucleus in about half of the cells
whereas the nuclear GNE signal is weaker or absent in the other half. At 2 h following Nocodazole treatment, the Golgi apparatus is recovered as evidenced by
the golgin-97 antibody (N). GNE also partially redistributes to the Golgi compartment as demonstrated in the overlay (O) whereas nuclear GNE staining
remains heterogenous (M and O). Scale bar, 10 Am. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
