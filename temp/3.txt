## Introduction

GNE myopathy (OMIM 605820) is a rare genetic muscle disease
characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy due to
mutation in GNE, the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme due to
mutations in GNE, the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase/ N-acetylmannosamine
(ManNAc) kinase (EC:3.2.1.183, EC:2.7.1.60)
