## GNE Myopathy: Etiology, Diagnosis, and Therapeutic
Challenges

GNE myopathy (OMIM 605820) is a rare genetic muscle
disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle
atrophy due to mutations in GNE, the gene encoding the
bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
2-epimerase/ N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase
(EC:3.2.1.183, EC:2.7.1.60) (Fig. 1).
