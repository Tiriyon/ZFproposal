To verify the localization of endogenous GNE observed by
immunofluorescence, we analyzed the distribution of a
recombinantly expressed N-terminally (FLAG) 3 -tagged version of
GNE. 

-- Localization of GNE (endogenous) was done via analysis of
distribution of recombinant N-terminally FLAG 3 tagged version of
GNE. 

At about 50% confluency, HeLa cells were transfected with an
amphotropic retrovirus containing GNE cDNA (coding exons
2\u201312) under the control of a CMV promoter. 

-- GNE cDNA /w CMV promoter into HeLa cells.

The cells were stained simultaneously with an anti-FLAG antibody
and the GNE antibody. 

-- Stained with anti-FLAG antibody and GNE antibody.

Confocal laser scan- ning microscopy revealed colocalization in
the Golgi and the nucleus (Fig. 5).

-- Colocalization in Golgi and nucleus.

Additionally, (FLAG) 3 -tagged GNE translation products were
visualized in several small clusters in the cytoplasm. 

-- FLAG 3 tagged GNE seen in several small clusters in cytoplasm
[should I worry about this in my research?]

Unlike endogenous GNE, the FLAG-tagged construct marks the Golgi
complex more strongly than the nucleus.

-- FLAG tagged marks golgi stronger than endogenous GNE. [Could
be since FLAG tag associates better than GNE antiserum].
