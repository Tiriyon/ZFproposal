**Sialic Acid**
What are Sialic acids?
Sialic acids are a derivative of neuraminic acid,
an acidic sugar with a nine carbon backbone. 
The most common member of this group is N-acetylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Ac or NANA).

Where are they located?
Sialic acids are located on the distal side of glycan chains
in many vertebrate cell surface glycoconjugates

What are sialic acids for?
Regulation of glycoprotein stability

, cruicial in controlling cellular 
interactions, including cell adhesion,
