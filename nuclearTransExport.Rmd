Nucleocytoplasmic exchange occurs via dedicated multi-protein
structures spanning the nuclear envelope, termed 'Nuclear Pore
Complexes'  (NPCs). 
Kraus2005

Two types of transport are mediated by the NPC. Passive diffusion
allows the exchange of ions and small molecules, including
proteins smaller than 40-60 kDa, while the translocation of
larger proteing or protein complexes is controlled by nuclear
localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs).
