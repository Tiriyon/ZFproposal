Notes:
  High likelyhood that I need to merge this section with the next
  section.

  FB T7 recombination
  GNE multiple mutations variants
  GNE Fragments, e.g. kinase and epimerase domains

  1. Frankenbodies I have 3 frankenbody plasmids: a. mEGFP; b.
     mCh; and c. mEGFP with his tag.
  2. For plasmids a. FBgfp, and b. FBmCh; I need to insert a T7
     promoter for _in vitro_ transcription into mRNA.
  3. I do that using synthesized oligo with sticky ends
     complementary to the restriction enzymes I use on the
     plasmid. 
  4. What I do here is cut both plasmids FBgfp and FBmCh with
     HindIII and BglII and ligate the T7 oligo at position
     \_\_\_\_ and transform into HIT competent cells.
  5. Afterwards I extract the plasmid using miniprep.
  6. After miniprep I screen the result using a PCR to amplify
     a segment containing the T7 insert and validate using
     another RE - I need to check which of BglII or HindIII are
     removed from the oligo restriction site - and examine if the
     PCR product is cut or not. Absence of a digestion on agarose
     gel electroporation is the required result.
  
  1. For Dynamin I just transform and isolate using miniprep.

  1. For GNE, thing are in the dark.
  2. First I need to generate, or recombinate an HA tag, then
     I need to generate different mutations on the vectorized
     gene.
  3. What tag do I want?
  4. To recombinate the HA tag I will use similar method of
     digestion and oligo ligation.
  5. Mutations: Which mutations am I interested in?
  6. To generate point mutations I will use Site-Directed
     mutagenesis or PCR site directed mutagenesis resources:
     [Addgene blog
     post](https://blog.addgene.org/site-directed-mutagenesis-by-pcr)
     and [Methods in
     enzymology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124186873000197?via%3Dihub)


### Plasmid cloning

  Bacteria and cloning
  FB
  DNM1
  GNE

### IVT
  
  FB, GNE and DNM1

### DMN1 & FB feasibility examination

  Inject DNM1 and FB as plasmid and mRNA for viability
  examination of the tools in zebrafish.

### Microinjection

  DNM1 & FB Plasmid
  FB & GNE

### Fluorescence Microscopy


### Notes to self:

* Found this really cool website - plasmaDNA.net. Plasmid manipulation tool.

### Free writing

To image GNE in live zebrafish a genetically encoded probe called
frankenbody (FB)[@Zhao2019] will be used in tandem with an HA
tagged GNE. Three different FB probes are available by @Zhao2019.
To avoid a mosaic expression as is in the case of plasmid
microinjection in zebrafish [@Kague2010], microinjection of mRNA
is preferred. As FB probes' plasmids are shipped with CMV
promoter only, I will perform a T7 promoter recombination into
both FBgfp and FBmCh. Insertion of T7 synthesized oligo
(Integrated DNA Technologies) will take place on the same locus
on both plasmids with plasmid digestion on HindIII and BglII with
sticky end ligation using T4 (NEB).
