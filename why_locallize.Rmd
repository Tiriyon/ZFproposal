The biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid is known for more than 30
years.
Kraus2005 ref 17.

Although it is known for more than 30 years, subcellular
localization of the essential enzymes in mammals remained
elusive.
Kraus2005.

GNE and CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase have been characterized at the
molecular level in the mammalian pathway.
Kraus2005
CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase has been found amost exclusively in the
cell nucleus.
Kraus2005, ref 18,19

CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase in the cell nucleus suggests that
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of substrate intermediates might be
involved in sialic acid biosynthesis.
Kraus2005.

These motifs are recognized by soluble import and export
receptors, which can associate with nucleoprorings in the NPC,
thus leading to transport of cargo across the nuclear membrane.
Kraus2005 ref 20 - review.

Most common NES is a short stretch of characteristically spaced
hydrophobic amino acids as first described for the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and PKI proteins.
Kraus2005, ref 21,22.

The precise cubcellular localization of GNE has not been
investigated yet.
Kraus2005.

Kraus show cytoplasmic targeting of GNE to the Golgi complex with
prominent nuclear localization which suggests additional
functional roles for GNE.
Kraus2005.
